# 👋 Hey there! I'm Yanis Kaced

🎯 I'm a Computer Science student in London, on a mission to become a strong backend developer who can build secure, scalable systems and deploy them with confidence.

## 💡 About Me

I love solving real-world problems with code — whether it’s designing a task manager for students, building a contact form for a business, or simply creating tools that make life easier.

I'm passionate about writing **clean, well-structured code**, and I care deeply about the **security, reliability, and quality** of the backends I build. I enjoy learning how systems work under the hood, and I’m constantly expanding my knowledge of **deployment, DevOps, and cloud infrastructure**.

I also believe that software development is a team sport. I work well in collaborative environments, communicate clearly, and I’m always open to feedback and mentorship. Whether I’m contributing to a group project or asking questions on GitHub, I always bring a willingness to learn and improve.

## 📚 Computer Science Foundations

I'm not just a tool user — I understand the **foundations** that make great developers:

- ✅ Data Structures & Algorithms
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming
- ✅ Relational Databases & ERDs
- ✅ SQL Queries & Normalization
- ✅ API Design & Architecture (MVC, REST)

## 🚀 Projects

I’m actively working on a few backend-focused projects:

- 🧩 **Task Manager API** — Flask-based REST API for task creation, user auth, and file persistence  
- 🌐 **Portfolio Website** — Personal site built with Flask, SQLite, Docker, and deployed via Render  
- ⚙️ **CI/CD Demo Repo** — Auto-deploys to cloud using GitHub Actions  
- 🔐 **Auth System** — Secure login system with bcrypt, token auth, and proper session handling

All projects are documented clearly with READMEs and deployment instructions. I strive to make every repo recruiter-friendly and technically professional.

## 🌍 I’m Open To...

- Internship opportunities in backend or DevOps roles (Summer 2026)
- Collaborating on open-source or real-world coding projects
- Learning from experienced engineers and mentoring juniors someday
