# 👋 Hi, I’m Yanis Kaced

🎯 I'm a Computer Science student in London (University of Westminster), on a mission to become a **cloud-ready backend developer** by 2027. I’m passionate about building secure, scalable APIs and deploying real-world systems using tools like **Python, Flask, Docker, AWS, and GitHub Actions**.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🔧 Building and deploying real backend projects with Docker and CI/CD
- 🌐 Learning to design REST APIs with authentication and database integration
- ☁️ Practicing AWS EC2, S3, and cloud deployment strategies
- 🧪 Writing unit tests and learning clean backend architecture (MVC, layered)
- 🛡️ Exploring secure development: JWT, password hashing, CORS


## 📖 Background

- 🧱 Solid foundation in **data structures**, **OOP**, and **SQL normalization**
- 📚 Currently learning backend security and deployment best practices
- 💬 I value **clean code**, **version control**, and **clear architecture**
- 🤖 I use AI (like ChatGPT) as a **tool**, not a crutch — everything here is built with understanding
